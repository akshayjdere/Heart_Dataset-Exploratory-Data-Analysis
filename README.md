# Heart_Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Overview:
  This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Heart Dataset using Python. The analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging popular data manipulation and visualization libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the Heart Dataset by performing EDA. The process involves checking for null and duplicated values to enhance data integrity. The steps include data cleaning and the utilization of various visualization techniques such as heatmap, countplot, distplot, boxplot, histogram, and facetgrid from Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Key Insights
Out of 100% of individuals, approximately 46.67% (47%) have heart-related diseases, indicating a significant prevalence.

The dataset comprises 96 females and 206 males, with 70% of females and 45% of males experiencing heart-related issues.

The majority of individuals fall within the age group of 45 to 70.

Chest pain analysis reveals that the most common type is typical angina.

A noteworthy finding is that even among individuals without heart problems, a substantial number still experience chest pain.

An analysis of fasting blood sugar levels indicates a potential risk of diabetes.

Hypertension is suggested by a majority of individuals having blood pressure over 130 mm Hg.

Around half of the individuals have cholesterol levels exceeding 240 mm/dl, considered high.

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:

Individuals with typical angina chest pain should undergo further evaluation for potential heart-related issues.
Regular monitoring of fasting blood sugar levels is crucial, especially for those with imbalances.
Lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, may be beneficial for individuals with high blood pressure or cholesterol levels.


Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into the Heart Dataset, highlighting patterns and potential risk factors associated with heart-related issues.
